# Public Insecurities

Work in progress. See live version [here](https://www.mikewesthad.com/public-insecurities-interactive.html).

This piece is based on a video installation from 2014 called Public Insecurities. More info [here](https://www.mikewesthad.com/projects/public-insecurities.html). When you search something in this app, it pulls Google search suggestions for the phrase you entered and types them back to you. These suggestions come from private searches, recorded by Google, which are anonymized and re-presented to us. By typing a few, charged words into a search bar, expressions of collective, private insecurities can be uncovered.
